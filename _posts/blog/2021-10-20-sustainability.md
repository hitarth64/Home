Gave an invited talk as part of Sustainable Engineers Association Seminar at University of Toronto. 

I talked about the state-of-the-art methods for energy materials discovery and challenges that we face even with the most powerful tools at our hand. My slides can be found at [slides](https://github.com/hitarth64/hitarth64.github.io/blob/master/_posts/blog/sustainability_talk.pdf). It was great to see many young researchers interested in exploring the field. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to ping me on my email or Twitter.

I recetly got the opportunity to present at Sustainable Engineers Association Seminar at University of Toronto. 

I talked about the present picture of the state-of-the-art methods for energy materials discovery and challenges that we face even with the most updated tools at our hand. My slides can be found at [slides](sustainability_talk.pdf). If you have any questions or comments, feel free to ping me on my email or Twitter.

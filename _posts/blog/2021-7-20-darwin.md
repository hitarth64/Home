I recetly got the opportunity to present one of our recent papers [DARWIN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04383) at Accelerated Materials Discovery speaker series. Got an opportunity to present and discuss our findings with awesome scientists.

If you missed out on hearing me blabber about Machine Learning and quantum chemistry but are interested in knowing the gist, you can find the slides [here](https://github.com/hitarth64/hitarth64.github.io/blob/master/interpretable_discovery.pdf)

I recetly got the opportunity to present one of our recent papers [DARWIN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04383) at Accelerated Materials Discovery speaker series and discussed our findings with awesome scientists there.

If you missed out on hearing me blabber about Machine Learning and quantum chemistry but are interested in knowing the gist, you can find the slides [here](https://github.com/hitarth64/hitarth64.github.io/blob/master/interpretable_discovery.pdf)

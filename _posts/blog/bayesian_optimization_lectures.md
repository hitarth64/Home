As part of a lecture series on Machine Learning, I delivered a couple of lectures on Bayesian Optimization and Gaussian Processes. 
I have made the lecture notes available on my [github repo](https://github.com/hitarth64/bayesian_optimization_A3MD_talk)

The lectures cover introduction to Gaussian Processes, bayesian optimization and various ways we can perform bayesian optimization. 
Any comments or suggestions are always welcome!

I am a graduate student at Department of ECE, University of Toronto. My interests are concentrated around the applications of Machine Learning and Signal Processing with a strong emphasis on mathematical aspects of the theory.  

At present, I am working with Professor **Ted Sargent** at ECE, UofT. Feel free to contact if you think that there is an opportunity available that matches my interest.

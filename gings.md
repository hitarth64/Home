* For the new comers, Gings is the short form for graduate life musings or geeky musings. 
* I hope to contribute fun questions and musings. Since, I am new to Jekyll-Github combo, it will take some time before I get familiar.
* GG1 (28/09/2018): Getting your project proposal accepted is more important than your crush accepting your proposal. 
* GG2 (13/10/2018): You are a true grad student if even at 3AM, you want to do your research instead of sleeping away.

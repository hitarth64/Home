* For the new comers, Gings is the short form for graduate life musings or geeky musings. 

* I hope to contribute fun questions and musings. Since, I am new to Jekyll-Github combo, it will take some time before I get familiar.

* GG1 (28/09/2018): Always keep Friday & Saturday nights free - thank me later :) 

* GG2 (13/10/2018): You are a true grad student if even at 3AM, you want to do your research instead of sleeping away. 

* GG3 (04/11/2018): A true student develops love for the course a day before the exams.

* GG4 (13/01/2019): You aren't a true grad student unless you make your friends forcefully listen to all the non-sense gibberish that all there is in your research and then come upon eureka moment by that feat!

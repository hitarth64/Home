こんにちは！私はHitarthです。「Hello！I am Hitarth] 

I am a graduate student at Department of ECE, University of Toronto. 

This webpage is meant to showcase some of my works and I try to use it as a means to spread science awareness. 

If you are looking to learn things about me and my work, give [Research](https://hitarth64.github.io/ee/) and [Projects](https://hitarth64.github.io/projects/) tabs a look. 

For the curious souls out there, I definitely recommend checking out the [Trivia](https://hitarth64.github.io/trivia/) tab. If you find it interesting and wanna cross check answers or have some comments, feel free to tweet me or email me through links at the bottom of webpage.

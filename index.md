I am a PhD student at Department of ECE, University of Toronto. <br />


This webpage is meant to showcase some of my works and I try to use it as a means to spread science awareness. <br />


If you are looking to learn things about me and my work, give [Research](https://hitarth64.github.io/ee/) and [Projects](https://hitarth64.github.io/projects/) tabs a look. <br />


For the curious souls out there, I definitely recommend checking out the [Trivia](https://hitarth64.github.io/trivia/) tab. <br />

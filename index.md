Hey guys, this is Hitarth. This website is aimed to give you a tour of my technical skills, experience, projects and educational qualifications.

I am a graduate student at Department of ECE, University of Toronto. My interests are concentrated around the applications of Machine Learning and Signal Processing.  

At present, I am working with Professor **Ted Sargent** at ECE, UofT. Feel free to contact if you think that there is an opportunity available that matches my interest. Contact details are readily available at the bottom in form of my email address and Github account handle.

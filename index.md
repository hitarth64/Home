Hey guys, this is Hitarth. Welcome to my website!

I am a graduate student at Department of ECE, University of Toronto. 

Built this webpage to show case some of my works and as a means to entertain everyone through my projects and hobbies! 

For the curious souls out there, I definitely recommend checking out the [Trivia](https://hitarth64.github.io/trivia/) section of my webpage.

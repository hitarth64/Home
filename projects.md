Few relevant & completed projects:

### [DARWIN: Interpretable Machine Learning for Quantum Chemistry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04383)
 * Accelerated search for materials with user specified set of target properties
 * Graph neural network architecture that learns and generalizes from small datasets
 * Automated discovery pipeline for interpretable design rules

### [Crystal Site Feature Embedding](https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(20)30187-9)
  * Developed a new representation which achieves state of the art accuracies for bandgaps(0.1 eV) and energies(0.007 eV/atom). 
  * Achieves an unprecedented acceleration factor of 10<sup>101</sup> for materials and composition exploration
  * Density Functional Theory (DFT) based exploration and training. 

### Investigation of generalization in deep neural networks
  * Investigative study of how and when we have learning and when we have simple memorization of the training data
  * **Bayesian Evidence** as a tool to explain the observations and to predict if we will observe good generalization. [Link](generalization_nn.pdf)


### Genetic variants classification 
  * Exploration of various machine learning strategies to find the best model which performs best in predicting how likely a genetic variant is have conflicting clinical classifications. [Link to report & code](https://github.com/hitarth64/statistical-learning/tree/master/project)
  
### NLP inspired model for designing a successful Kickstarter Campaign 
 * Combining Natural Language processing (NLP) with stanadard mahine learning techniques, developed a classifier to predict success accuracy of the campaign based on its description, goal targeted, duration of the campaign, etc.
 * word2vec models to articulate most likely to succeed description for the campaign; (multiple contributions)  [Link](https://github.com/yanchenm/dessa-comp)

### NLP to analyze podcasts
 * Using NLTK to do some really fun & cool NLP on one of the podcasts I like a lot. 
 * If you have some cool idea which I should try on, please drop me a tweet or message!
 * Ongoing hobby project! [Link](https://github.com/hitarth64/nltk_podcast)

Page still under Construction - adding project descriptions (Sorry for inconvinience): 

Few relevant & interesting projects:

## Accelerated Materials Discovery
  * Machine learning quantum physics to search large chemical space (**O(10<sup>41</sup>)**) to find favorable materials for photonics and quantum computing applications
  * Density Functional Theory (DFT) based exploration and training. 
  
## Genetic variants classification 
## DSP application in Genomics & Proteomics
## Shearlets & Curvelets for solving PDEs
## Video Reconstruction using Compressive Sensing
## Anisotropic diffusion based image compression
## Query Handling Systems
## Implementation of OFDM
## Portable Planeterium

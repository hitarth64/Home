Page still under Construction - adding project descriptions (Sorry for inconvinience): 

Few relevant & interesting projects:

### Accelerated Materials Discovery
  * Machine learning quantum physics to search large chemical space (**O(10<sup>41</sup>)**) to find favorable materials for photonics and quantum computing applications
  * Density Functional Theory (DFT) based exploration and training. 


### Investigation of generalization in deep neural networks
  * Investigative study of how and when we have learning and when we have simple memorization of the training data
  * **Bayesian Evidence** as a tool to explain the observations and to predict if we will observe good generalization. [Link](generalization_nn.pdf)


### Genetic variants classification 
  * Exploration of various machine learning strategies to find the best model which performs best in predicting how likely a genetic variant is have conflicting clinical classifications. 

### DSP application in Genomics & Proteomics
### Shearlets & Curvelets for solving PDEs
### Video Reconstruction using Compressive Sensing
### Anisotropic diffusion based image compression
### Query Handling Systems
### Implementation of OFDM
### Portable Planeterium

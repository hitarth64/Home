Page still under Construction - adding project descriptions (Sorry for inconvinience): 

Few relevant & interesting projects:

### Accelerated Materials Discovery
  * Machine learning quantum physics to search large chemical space (**O(10<sup>41</sup>)**) to find favorable materials for photonics and quantum computing applications
  * Density Functional Theory (DFT) based exploration and training. 


### Investigation of generalization in deep neural networks
  * Investigative study of how and when we have learning and when we have simple memorization of the training data
  * **Bayesian Evidence** as a tool to explain the observations and to predict if we will observe good generalization. [Link](generalization_nn.pdf)


### Genetic variants classification 
  * Exploration of various machine learning strategies to find the best model which performs best in predicting how likely a genetic variant is have conflicting clinical classifications. [Link to report & code](https://github.com/hitarth64/statistical-learning/tree/master/project)
  
### NLP inspired model for designing a successful Kickstarter Campaign 
 * Combining Natural Language processing (NLP) with stanadard mahine learning techniques, developed a classifier to predict success accuracy of the campaign based on its description, goal targeted, duration of the campaign, etc.
 * word2vec models to articulate most likely to succeed description for the campaign; (multiple contributions)  [Link](https://github.com/yanchenm/dessa-comp)

### NLP to analyze podcasts
 * Using NLTK to do some really fun & cool NLP on one of the podcasts I like a lot. 
 * Ongoing hobby project! [Link](https://github.com/hitarth64/nltk_podcast)

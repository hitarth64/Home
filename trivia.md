* In my free time, I love to solve mathematical puzzles or write poems/stories - some which could be found at

* I try to solve at least one maths puzzle everyday. Here are a few that I have found interesting and fun (Last updated: 5 Nov 2019):

1. Your boss tells you to bring him a cup of coffee from the company vending machine. The problem is the machine is broken. When you press the button for a drink, it will randomly fill a percentage of the cup (between 0 and 100 percent). You know you need to bring a full cup back to your boss. Whatâ€™s the expected number of times you will have to fill the cup? (source: cseblog.com)

2. In an election, two candidates, Albert and Benjamin, have in a ballot box a and b votes respectively, a>b, for example, 3 and 2. If the ballots are randomly drawn and tallied, what's the chance that at least once after the first tally the candidates have the same number of tallies? (source: 50 challenging problems)

3. You have 25 horses, you want to pick the fastest 3 horses out of those 25. In each race, only 5 horses can run at the same time. What is the minimum number of races required to find the 3 fastest horses without using a stopwatch? (source: a friend asked me)

4. Pick independent random numbers at uniform from [0,1] and add them together. How many random numbers do you expect to need before the total first exceeds 1? (Source: Twitter [@octonion](https://twitter.com/octonion)) (I loved this!)

5. How thick should a coin be to have a 1/3 chance of landing on edge? (Was trying to make coin stand on the magnetic strip of my laptop and started thinking of this. Von Neumann was asked this and he answered it in 20 seconds)

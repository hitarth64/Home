* In my free time, I love to solve mathematical puzzles or write poems/stories - some which could be found at

* I try to solve at least one maths puzzle everyday. Here are a few that I have found interesting and fun:

1. Your boss tells you to bring him a cup of coffee from the company vending machine. The problem is the machine is broken. When you press the button for a drink, it will randomly fill a percentage of the cup (between 0 and 100 percent). You know you need to bring a full cup back to your boss. Whatâ€™s the expected number of times you will have to fill the cup? (source: cseblog.com)

2. In an election, two candidates, Albert and Benjamin, have in a ballot box a and b votes respectively, a>b, for example, 3 and 2. If the ballots are randomly drawn and tallied, what's the chance that at least once after the first tally the candidates have the same number of tallies? (source: 50 challenging problems)

3. You have 25 horses, you want to pick the fastest 3 horses out of those 25. In each race, only 5 horses can run at the same time. What is the minimum number of races required to find the 3 fastest horses without using a stopwatch? (source: a friend asked me)

* Most likely if I am not attending a class, you can find me in my office GB-427 in the ECE department.
* In my free time, I love to solve mathematical puzzles or write poems/stories - some which could be found at
[Cryptic Castle](https://hitarth64.blogspot.com)
* So, if you have found a good mathematical puzzle, send it to me. If your question intrigues me, there is a chance that you may get a treat. :P 
* I am more of a city person than a countryside person. :D

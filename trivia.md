* I love playing volleyball or foosball. Count me in if you want to play it! 
* In my free time, I love to solve mathematical puzzles or write poems/stories - some which could be found at
[Cryptic Castle](https://hitarth64.blogspot.com)
* So, if you have found a good mathematical puzzle, send it to me. If your question intrigues me, there is a chance that you may get a treat. :P 

* I hope to contribute fun questions and some fun musings I have experienced over time. 

* M1 (28/09/2018): Always keep Friday & Saturday nights free - thank me later :) 

* M2 (13/10/2018): You are a true grad student if even at 3AM, you want to do your research instead of sleeping away. 

* M3 (04/11/2018): A true student develops love for the course a day before the exams.

* M4 (13/01/2019): You aren't a true grad student unless you make your friends forcefully listen to all the non-sense gibberish that all there is in your research and then come upon eureka moment by that feat!
